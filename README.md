Week/Sprint/Model 4 Challenge - Coding Assesment Quiz

## Description

This project is a coding assessment quiz, where the user answers questions about javascript within a certain time. It records the current score, five high scores, and allows the high scores to be cleared and the quiz to be taken again. The user is notified whether their answer is correct or incorrect after answering each question. The quiz is timed for 90 seconds, each incorrect answer will take 5 seconds away, each correct answer is worth 10 points. The score is calculated based on the seconds left at the end of the quiz and the number of correct answers.

## Usage

This project can be used to test basic knowledge about javascript, specifically the functionalities I encountered when making the quiz. Its creation was meant to test our knowledge of setting attributes, creating elements, removing elements, setting a timer, storing data, appending elements, adding new data to local storage, clearing the storage, and sorting arrays. It drove me to near tears.
